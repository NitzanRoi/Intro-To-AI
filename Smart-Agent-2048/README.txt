Create an agent to intelligently play the 2048-puzzle game, 
using advanced techniques to probe the search space.
The code files PlayerAI.py and my_code.py contain the implementation of an 
adversarial search algorithm (minimax with alpha-beta pruning) 
that plays the game intelligently. All the rest code files are the 
course team implementation of the game. The shell command to run the 
game is python3 GameManager.py.
